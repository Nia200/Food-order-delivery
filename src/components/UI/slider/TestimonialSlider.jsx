          with bison burgers and shakes. They also have great happy hour deals
          on drinks. The food itself was just not that good not even considering
          the price. Maybe they need to use different seasonings or oil, idk. It
          was bland. All I know is I have had much better impossible burgers and
          my friend agreed with his bacon burger. The impossible nuggets were
          solid â€” cooked crispy with chipotle ranch and garlic aioli sauces."

          favorite is the truffle burger with a side of grilled baby Brussel
